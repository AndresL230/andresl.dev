            I&apos;m a sophomore at Boston University pursuing degrees in{' '}
            <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Business</strong>. I sit at
            the intersection of engineering and real world problems. I build real things, ship
            fast, and think in systems. Whether it&apos;s an NLP pipeline or a financial
            model, I care about how things actually work.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;ve competed at PennApps, HackHarvard, and the Capital One Tech Summit.
            Outside class I&apos;m into <strong>data engineering</strong>,{' '}
            <strong>backend development</strong>, and system infrastructure.
            Most of my best work happens under a deadline.
