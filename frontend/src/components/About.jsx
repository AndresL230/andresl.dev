          <p>
            I&apos;m a sophomore at Boston University pursuing degrees in{' '}
            <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Business</strong>.  I like building things that sit at the intersection of engineering and real-world problems, whether that's an NLP pipeline, a data dashboard, or a financial model.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently work as a software engineer at <strong>Hack4Impact</strong>, building backend systems and tools for local nonprofits.
            I love competing at hackathons and have been to PennApps, HackHarvard, Civichacks, the Capital One Tech Summit, and a bunch of others.
            There&apos;s something about building under pressure that brings out some of my best work.
            Outside of class, I spend most of my time on <strong>data engineering</strong>,{' '}
            <strong>backend systems</strong>, and whatever new AI tooling I can get my hands on.
